          When you contact {business.name} on WhatsApp or through the short enquiry form, we receive
          the details you choose to share — usually your name, your phone number, your area and
          photos of the window problem.

          We use these details only to understand your problem, reply to you and arrange a repair or
          visit if one is needed.

          We do not sell your details. We do not send marketing emails. Photos you share stay in the
