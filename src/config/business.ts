  {
    q: "A local mistri told me I must replace the whole window for ₹20,000. Is that true?",
    a: "95% of the time, NO. When your window gets stuck or screechy, the aluminium frame inside your wall is completely fine! Only the cheap bottom nylon wheels have crushed, or dirt has clogged the track. Replacing just the wheels and bearings in 45 minutes restores 1-finger glide and saves you ₹15,000+ in cold hard cash.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much will my repair cost? Are there any hidden fees?",
    a: "Zero hidden fees. Costs depend on whether it's a standard bedroom window or a heavy 70kg balcony sliding door. When you send a 5-second video on WhatsApp, our technicians see the exact roller size and give you an upfront, fixed price before visiting. What we quote is what you pay.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if you come to my house and cannot fix the problem?",
    a: "You pay ₹0. Zero. Nada. We operate on a strict 'No Fix, No Fee' guarantee. If our technicians cannot get your sliding window or door to glide smoothly, you do not owe us a single rupee for the visit. All the risk is on us.",
  },
  {
    q: "I don't know what's broken or what technical words to use. How do I get help?",
    a: "You don't need any technical words at all. Forget terms like 'tandem rollers' or 'interlock'. Just point your phone, take a 5-second video or photo of the problem, and send it to our WhatsApp. We will diagnose it and tell you exactly what's wrong within 5 minutes.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will the repair make a mess, break tiles, or leave cement dust in my home?",
    a: "Zero civil mess. We are precision hardware restoration specialists, not wall-breakers. We lift the sliding shutter, replace the worn-out rollers, service the track, and put it right back. The entire job takes 45 minutes with no broken tiles, no cement, and no dust on your furniture.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which areas in Mumbai do you cover, and how quickly can you visit?",
    a: "We provide 100% doorstep service anywhere in Mumbai — Powai, Bandra, Andheri, Worli, South Mumbai, Chembur, Ghatkopar, Goregaon, Malad, Mulund, and surrounding suburbs. Because our service vans carry heavy-duty replacement parts, we offer same-day doorstep visits. Message us early to lock in today's slot.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you install invisible grills and pigeon nets?",
    a: "Yes. We install SS316 stainless steel invisible grills and UV-stabilized pigeon nets for balconies, windows and AC ducts across Powai and Mumbai. Send a photo of the balcony or window on WhatsApp and we will share the measurement visit slot and a per sq. ft. quote.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I actually need brand new windows or soundproof glass?",
    a: "We do that too! If you are renovating or your old wooden/iron frames are completely rusted, we custom-fabricate brand new Jindal Aluminium, luxury Domal sliding systems, and acoustic soundproof DGU glass directly from our Powai workshop.",
